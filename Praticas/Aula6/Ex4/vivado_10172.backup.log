CRITICAL WARNING: [BD 41-1761] Reset pin '/clock_divider_1hz_0/reset' is found to be associated with multiple clock pins, which are not compatible w.r.t frequency, phase and clock-domain. This may prevent design from functioning correctly. Please ensure same reset pin is either not associated with different clock pins or all associated clock pins are driven by same or compatible clock source(s). List of associated clock pins:
/clock_divider_1hz_0/clk
/clock_divider_1hz_0/divided_clk

WARNING: [BD 41-927] Following properties on pin /clock_divider_1hz_0/divided_clk have been updated from connected ip. They may not be synchronized with cell properties. You can set property on pin directly to confirm the value and resolve the warning.

INFO: [Labtools 27-1434] Device xc7a100t (JTAG device index = 0) is programmed with a design that has no supported debug core(s) in it.
WARNING: [Labtools 27-3123] The debug hub core was not detected at User Scan Chain 1 or 3.
Resolution: 
1. Make sure the clock connected to the debug hub (dbg_hub) core is a free running clock and is active OR
2. Manually launch hw_server with -e "set xsdb-user-bscan <C_USER_SCAN_CHAIN scan_chain_number>" to detect the debug hub at User Scan Chain of 2 or 4. To determine the user scan chain setting, open the implemented design and use: get_property C_USER_SCAN_CHAIN [get_debug_cores dbg_hub].
